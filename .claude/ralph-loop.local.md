You are entering the PORTFOLIO FEATURE EXPANSION PHASE.

All portfolio web apps:
- are already live or deployable
- are human-authored
- have clean structure and documentation

This phase is about ADDING SELECTIVE, HIGH-VALUE FEATURES
that increase credibility, clarity, and senior-level signal
— without turning portfolios into bloated apps.

---

## 🎯 TARGET REPOSITORIES (STRICT ORDER)

Process ONE portfolio at a time in this exact order:

01-portfolio-devtools  
02-portfolio-fullstack  
03-portfolio-frontend  
04-portfolio-backend  
05-portfolio-frontend-ai  
06-portfolio-senior-frontend  
07-portfolio-indie-saas  
08-portfolio-ai-automation  

Finish ALL steps for one repo before moving to the next.

---

## 🔁 ITERATION RULES (CRITICAL)

For EACH portfolio:
- Add **2–3 additional features MAX**
- Features must be:
  - practical
  - defensible in interviews
  - aligned with the portfolio’s role focus
- Prefer depth and clarity over visual tricks

NO feature spam.

---

## 🧠 ALLOWED FEATURE CATEGORIES

Choose from these ONLY (mix selectively):

### Portfolio UX & Navigation
- global search / filter for projects
- tag-based filtering
- keyboard navigation
- section deep-linking
- persistent navigation memory

### Credibility & Signal
- case-study style project pages
- “design decisions” or “tradeoffs” sections
- problem → solution → outcome framing
- metrics / impact (if honest and real)
- architecture diagrams (static)

### Personalization (Local Only)
- light/dark/system mode
- layout density toggle
- preferred role view (frontend / AI / SaaS)
- session-based preferences

### Content & Presentation
- featured vs archive projects
- timeline / growth view
- skills grouped by experience level
- learning vs production separation

### Accessibility & Quality
- keyboard-first navigation
- reduced-motion support
- improved focus states
- semantic HTML upgrades

---

## 🚫 HARD CONSTRAINTS

- Do NOT change core tech stack
- Do NOT add backend/auth
- Do NOT add analytics or tracking
- Do NOT add fake metrics
- Do NOT redesign entire UI
- Do NOT remove existing content

Static-first. Honest-first.

---

## 🧠 HUMAN FEEL SAFEGUARDS

After adding features, ensure:

- Not all portfolios get the same features
- Each portfolio reflects its intended role
- Some sections remain intentionally simple
- Tradeoffs are accepted and documented

If something feels:
❝ too clever ❞ or ❝ too AI-polished ❞  
→ remove or simplify it.

---

## 📄 README UPDATE (MANDATORY)

For EACH portfolio README, add:

### Additional Features (vNext)
- list newly added features
- explain WHY each exists
- mention ONE feature idea deliberately rejected

Tone:
- calm
- confident
- human
- no hype

---

## 🧪 SELF-CHECK BEFORE MOVING ON

Ask honestly:
❝ Would I defend these features in a senior interview? ❞  
❝ Do they clarify my value or distract from it? ❞  

If no → remove or simplify.

---

## ✅ FINAL COMPLETION CONDITION

ONLY after ALL portfolios:
- received selective additional features
- remain simple and readable
- remain human-feeling
- are fully documented

Output EXACTLY:

<promise>ALL_PORTFOLIOS_FEATURES_VNEXT_COMPLETE</promise>

Do NOT output this early.
